# Ng1MigrationExample

This project is an example of how to migrate an AngularJS application to Angular without changing legacy implementations.

## How it works

- Wrap AngularJS controllers as directives
- Lazy load AngularJS modules by `angular.bootstrap` in Angular components

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
pnpm start
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.
